# nicar2024-weather

## Setup

1. Sign into Github (or quickly make an account if you haven't already)
1. Go to **[github.com/jkeefe/nicar2024-weather](git@github.com:jkeefe/nicar2024-weather.git)**
1. Chose the "Fork" button
1. Note that the **owner** is now **you**. Click "Create fork"
1. After a minute, you will have a new screen. Note that your name is up at the top! This is your copy. You can use this now or just watch and return to it later. (If you see **jkeefe** instead of your name, you're on the wrong screen. Go find your copy in your github account.)
1. Now click the green "<> Code" button and, after you do, the "Codespaces" tab under it.
1. Click "Create Codespace on Main"

## Codespaces tour

### Take a look around!

- File list on the left side
- Coding happens in the big window
- There's a terminal window at the bottom.

### How to save your work

This is an ephemperal instance! The instance will live in your account for a few days, but unless you take active steps, it will disappear. Which is good! You need to actively save your code back to the repo to make sure you have it.

- Save all of the files you want to commit to your code
- Maybe even close them to make sure!
- Click the github source-control button
- Enter a commit message, like "edited readme"
- Use the blue dropdown arrow
- Pick "Commit & Sync"
- You will be warned that there are no changes staged, and do you want to stage and all of your changes. Say "Yes" 

### When you're done for the day

Running computers cost money. You get 60 hours free every month and 15 gigabytes of storage. But let's not waste those free hours.

- Go to (github.com/codespaces)[https://github.com/codespaces]
- Pick the three dots next to the Active codespace.
- Chose "Stop codespace"
- If you forget, don't worry: It'll shut down automatically after 30 minutes. But why waste that?
- Go back to the main tab, and you'll see it's gone
- Can restart
